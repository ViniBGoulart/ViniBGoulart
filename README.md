### Hi there, I'm Vinicius

I'm a software engineer. I'm interested in dev experience, especially in fullstack operations. I like to build products and validate ideas.

I'm already build:

- [Event List](https://github.com/event-list/event-list), a software to share and manage your party.
- [Gymang](https://github.com/vinibgoulart/gymang), a software to manage your workouts.

I'm currently building:

- [Mundo Otico](https://omundootico.com/), a complete ERP to manage your customers, products and orders.

Currently working with react, node, typescript, relay, graphql.
